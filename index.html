              <h5>Program Overview</h5>
              <p>Founded in 2011, Vision Academy has increased access to summer and afterschool programs for children and youth in the Bayview and Mission districts of San Francisco.</p>

              <p>Our program works largely with African-American and Latino youth, providing education and enrichment programming designed to support their academic needs and bridge any achievement gaps.</p>

              <p>Presently, Vision Academy conducts a community-based afterschool program providing tri-lingual homework assistance (English / Spanish / Chinese) with an emphasis on mathematics and literacy, specialized chess instruction services delivered to partner afterschool programs, and a comprehensive summer day-camp designed to prevent summer learning loss.</p>

              <p>To ensure successful outcomes for each participant, our program and staff works diligently to engage and collaborate with parents, teachers, volunteers, PTAs, schools, churches, other afterschool programs, and family service agencies.</p>

              <p>In the summer of 2015, Vision Academy became an official program of the <a href="http://www.goodsamfrc.org">Good Samaritan Family Resource Center</a>.
